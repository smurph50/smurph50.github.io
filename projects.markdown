### Finished

* [Time series gene expression of maturation](http://github.com/smurph50) <span>Single cell RNA-seq reconstruction in postnatal maturation of heart cells to develop methods of promoting maturation in vitro.</span>
* [Comparing maturation of different organs](http://github.com/smurph50)  <span>Global comparison of gene expression trends in different tissue types.</span>
* [Multiomics selection of cell therapy subpopulation](http://github.com/smurph50)  <span>Use single cell to identify strategies to purify safe cell types.</span>

### In development

* [Chromatin regulators in multiple models of reprogramming](http://github.com/smurph50) <span>Using CUT&RUN with ATAC-seq to characterize mechanisms of transdifferentiation.</span>
* [Splicing in heart failure](http://github.com/smurph50) <span>Tracking alternative splicing from spliceosome component in the heart.</span>

### Outside of lab

* [Brake lights](http://github.com/smurph50) <span>Using python to model traffic to asnwer the question: how can drivers reduce traffic?</span>
* [Score more](http://github.com/smurph50) <span>UMAP clustering players to find the next best soccer stars.</span>
