### bio

I'm Sean, a postdoc in the Chulan Kwon Lab in the Institue for Cell Engineering and School of Medicine. Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University where I worked on engineering mature stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes in vitro by studying dynamic molecular pathways in postnatal mouse heart development. I grew up in Seattle and went to the University of Washington and left with a BS Bioengineering and BA Economics with a minor in Applied Mathematics. At that time, I worked in the lab of Michael Laflamme, which focused on cell therapy for heart disease. 

### mission

I seek to better understand how cells work and use that to develop therapies for disease. 

### volunteer and outreach

I have volunteered with Thread and Book Thing. I previously coached the JHU Ultimate b-team. As an undergrad, I worked in bioengineering/STEM outreach and helped out at the Roots Youth Shelter. 

### when I'm not in lab

**in the winter:** snowboarding, curling, hot cocoa

**in the summer:** outdoors/hiking, soccer, ultimate, golf, disc golf

**at home:** board games, books, Liverpool FC, landscape design
