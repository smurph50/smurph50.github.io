Iâ€™m a postdoc working in cell engineering using data science and bioinformatics. I use a mix of computational and wet lab experiments to answer scientific questions. My projects include both moonshots and very specific basic science questions. 

My research interests: 
- Prevention of heart failure by making cardiomyocytes ischemia-proof
- Mechanisms of cell fate stability and how to bypass them
- Prediction of cell state transtitions
