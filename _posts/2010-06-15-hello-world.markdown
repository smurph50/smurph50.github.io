Recycling your cans won't stop the climate crisis. It is clear that corporations as its more profitable to pollute. The only option is governmental action. Oil companies have shown that they will not change on their own. 

The problem is that the politicians are bought and controlled through campaign donations from large corporations. 

### How do I get Congress to do anything? 

The majority of politicians are focused getting re-elected. One vote can't change that, but voting blocks can. Find and support candidates that prioritize legislation to address greenhouse gas production.

### What do you do? 

- Switch your utilities to Wind Power if you live in a coal or natural gas powered region
- Talk to your congresspeople
- Join climate action movements
- Recycle, reuse, and reduce consumption
- Avoid red meat and animal products
- Take public transportation and trains when possible

### What are you going to do?

- Switch to an electric vehicle
- Start a voting block

### Its hopeless

Never give up!

### Well then

Let's get on with it.
