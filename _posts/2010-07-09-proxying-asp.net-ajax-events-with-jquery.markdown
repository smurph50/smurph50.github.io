The rise of AI and Machine Learning has created new excitement for drug discovery. The biggest question I see is how can ML speed up drug discovery? 

These are areas that ML has the potential to revolutionize:
- Modeling gene regulatory networks and the impact of drugs on a cell
- Clustering patients into subpopulations where drugs will be more effective
- Expanding drug space
- LLMs for protein design
- Summarizing the literature accurately
